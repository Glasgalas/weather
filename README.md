# Weather App

## What is this?

This is a small weather app that allows you to get weather by user location or
search for weather by city.

## How it works?

When launched, the application asks for permission to determine the user's
location, and, using the obtained coordinates, sends a request for weather data.
The weather data includes information about the city, country, air temperature,
humidity and wind speed, and even a corresponding icon is displayed. Depending
on the temperature of the location, the background color changes, and the user
also has the ability to change the temperature and, accordingly, the background
using the slider at the bottom of the page.

## Where does the information come from?

The application uses the free API OpenWeather
[https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/)
